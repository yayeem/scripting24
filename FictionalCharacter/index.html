         <p>Tantai Jin was born a mere mortal 500 years ago but was fated to be the next Devil God, a powerful force that embodies all evil karma, that will only bring death and destruction upon the world. He was known as the devil fetus and was born with an evil bone in his heart. He was the prince of the Kingdom of Jing but was sent to the Kingdom of Sheng as a hostage prince at the age of six. </p>

    <p>At a very young age, he was abused throughout his entire life. He has no friends and family so he never understands compassion, care, and love. He was born with no love lines so he doesn't have any emotions. He can't feel happy and sad. He won't feel scared, either. He has no human emotions  because nobody showed care for him, so he does not know the difference between right and wrong. He only perceives things by imitating the people around him. He is good to those who are good to him and those who are bad, he strikes back. </p>

    <p>When he was still young, he has the ability to communicate with birds. He got this from his mom, who was from the Moon tribe. As he grew older, he discovered that his blood can repel demons and that he can bear their demonic powers, as long as they can't kill him. He used this ability to obtain power and rule the world. He escaped the Kingdom of Sheng and went back to Jing Kingdom which he then became the king. </p>
