                    <h2>What awaits you in Dumaguete</h2>
                      <p>In Dumaguete, you can explore historical landmarks such as Rizal Boulevard, a great
                        spot for families to relax and take a walk along the coast. Additionally, the area is
                        surrounded by many hotels, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. If you enjoy visiting
                        churches, you can stop by the Saint Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral, the oldest church
                        on Negros Island and the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dumaguete. It is also a
                        popular wedding venue for many couples. Next to the church is the 1879 Campanario, a
                        heritage site that was used during the Spanish-Moro conflict in the 1800s to warn against
                        invaders. Visitors also light candles and offer prayers in the area. There is also Quezon
                        Park, a place where my family and I used to hang out every Sunday. It is named after
                        Manuel L. Quezon, the first president of the Philippines. Close to the park is the
                        Dumaguete Presidencia, now a branch of the National Museum. It used to serve as the
                        city hall and was once my elementary school. Every September, we celebrate the
                        Sandurot Festival to honor Dumaguete&apos;s rich history. Schools from across the city take
                        part in the festivities, and we enjoy watching the parade, even in the heat of the sun. The
                        vibrant costumes and creative dance performances bring a lot of excitement, making it a
                        fun experience for everyone. Another yearly celebration in the city is the Buglasan
                        Festival, also known as the "Festival of All Festivals." It brings together provinces from all
                        over Negros Oriental. Most of the activities take place around the capitol area, where you
                        can explore a two-week display of the best booths from each province, along with various
                        local products. The area becomes even more vibrant at night. These festivals are among
                        the events I have most enjoyed with my family and friends.</p>

              <br>
              <p>In the past, pirates frequently raided Dumaguete, stealing wealth and capturing people to sell as slaves. Built in the early 1800s, the Belfry served as a watchtower to warn residents of attacks, and while pirates are no longer a threat, the landmark remains a symbol of the city&apos;s resilience and growth.</p>
