She often focuses on nature, sunsets, sunrise, and urban scenes. In addition to photography, she records videos of her travels and loves editing them. To keep her memories alive, she created an <a href="http://www.instagram.com/meeyayii?igsh=MTBrYmJkeDv4WtjdA==" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account to share her work and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/meeigoout/photos" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page to document her adventures.<br><br>Although she is not particularly into music, she loves dancing and participates in simple dance <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/LDhwVTF9OHQ?si=1pxIWusQNWi8-6CJ" target="_blank">trends</a>. She joined a dance club, where she developed many close friendships. Selectively extroverted, Imee enjoys spending time with her close friends. Her passion for photography was inspired by her brother, while her sister encouraged her love of dancing. As the youngest in the family, she looked up to her siblings for the confidence they provided, enabling her to share those interests alongside them.<br><br>Imee worked as a software engineer for eight years. During this time, she served as a localization engineer before transitioning to a UI/UX designer in the Philippines, prior to moving to Canada. Her desire to enhance her skills in design and video editing motivated her to study abroad in a Multimedia Production program.

                <p>She enjoyed capturing sunrises and sunsets, often photographing these beautiful moments. She had come to realize that each sunrise or sunset was unique, even when taken from the same spot, as long as it was on a different day.<br><br>She also loved going on motorcycle joyrides, relishing the feeling of the wind as she rode. Exploring new places helped her unwind and recharge after a long, stressful week.</p>

                <h2>Travel Experience</h2>
                <p>When it was time to recharge and unwind after a stressful situation, she would travel to places she had never been, often heading to the beach. The white sand and crystal-clear blue water provided the peace and relaxation her body and soul craved. Once she was in the water, it felt completely differentâ€”almost as if she became a part of it, moving effortlessly with the flow. There was something about the beach that made her forget all the stress weighing her down.<br><br>She also loved chasing waterfalls. Being immersed in nature was an indescribable experience, and the sound of the flowing water brought her a deep sense of calm.</p>
